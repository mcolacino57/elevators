This repository contains all the code used in our paper "Queuing Safely for Elevator Systems amidst a Pandemic" by Sai Mali Ananthanarayanan, Charles C. Branas, Adam N. Elmachtoub, Clifford S. Stein and Yeqing Zhou.

The "data" folder contains all the csv passenger arrival files used to reproduce figures in the paper.

To generate any figure, run functions.py and the corresponding figure file.
